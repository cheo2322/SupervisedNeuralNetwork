# SupervisedNeuralNetwork
Set of Supervised Neural Networks: Perceptron, Pocket Perceptron, ADALINE, MADALINE I &amp; II, developed in MatLabR2015b, for classification.

To run this project, you must have installed MatLabR2015b or higher, for a better performance. This project has been tested with logic examples (AND, OR, XOR) in which -1 is false and 1 is true; for example: 1 AND -1 = -1.
