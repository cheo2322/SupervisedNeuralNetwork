# SupervisedNeuralNetwork
Set of Supervised Neural Networks: Perceptron, Pocket Perceptron, ADALINE, MADALINE I &amp; II, developed in MatLabR2015b, for classification.

To run this project, you must install MatLabR2015b or higher, and have basic knwoledge about supervised neural networks and Matlab commands. This project has been tested with logic examples (AND, OR, XOR) in which -1 is false and 1 is true; for example: 1 AND -1 = -1.
